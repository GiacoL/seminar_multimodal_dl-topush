## Intro

After we describe further modalities in the previous sections, we will look at truly multipurpose models. Multitask multimodal models have already been proposed, like UniT, which extends the transformer architecture to deal with different modalities and tasks. However, previous multitask multimodal models remain limited in different aspects, which we will describe and discuss further. To become genuinely multipurpose, however, a model must be able to solve different tasks without fine-tuning and must be capable of dealing with different modalities. Thus, it must be able to transfer knowledge in-between tasks but must also be able to allocate capabilities for different modalities.

The recently introduced deep learning architecture Pathways is designed to be multipurpose. Pathways builds on newly designed hardware and software dedicated to addressing the challenges of contemporary deep learning models, which are ever-growing, where GPT-3 might be the most prominent example. We will discuss previous drawbacks and describe how Pathways aims to solve these issues. Besides the hardware aspect, Pathways provides a large neural network constructed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The input is passed through the network on different paths. Each node of the network is itself a neural network aimed at solving a specific aspect of a task. Using these different neural networks inside the model allows the model to be multitask and transfer knowledge in-between tasks. Another important aspect of this architecture is the obtained sparsity. When computed, just necessary nodes are computed, resulting in higher overall performance.

Furthermore, the model is intended to absorb different modalities as input, where no implementation has been found. Multimodality is further used hypothetically in the initial blog post. However, the similar model PathNet also achieves multimodality. The only model based on Pathways is the language model (PaLM), which is multilingual and capable of understanding code and solving mathematical tasks. However, the multimodality here remains questionable. Future Pathways-based models might provide more insight if the claim to step further toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) of the authors of Pathways and PathNet is true or not. Eventually, we will discuss the impact of the new Pathways multipurpose model since it might have a large impact on deep learning in the upcoming future. Broader applicable models will become feasible yet also centralize the usage, thus reducing accessibility and subsequently research on these models.
