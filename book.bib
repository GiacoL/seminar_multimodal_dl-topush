abstract="We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model.",

  abstract = 	 {Text-to-image generation has traditionally focused on finding better modeling assumptions for training on a fixed dataset. These assumptions might involve complex architectures, auxiliary losses, or side information such as object part labels or segmentation masks supplied during training. We describe a simple approach for this task based on a transformer that autoregressively models the text and image tokens as a single stream of data. With sufficient data and scale, our approach is competitive with previous domain-specific models when evaluated in a zero-shot fashion.}

year = {2017},

abstract = {Agricultural monitoring, especially in developing countries, can help prevent famine and support humanitarian efforts. A central challenge is yield estimation, i.e., predicting crop yields before harvest.We introduce a scalable, accurate, and inexpensive method to predict crop yields using publicly available remote sensing data. Our approach improves existing techniques in three ways. First, we forego hand-crafted features traditionally used in the remote sensing community and propose an approach based on modern representation learning ideas. We also introduce a novel dimensionality reduction technique that allows us to train a Convolutional Neural Network or Long-short Term Memory network and automatically learn useful features even when labeled training data are scarce. Finally, we incorporate a Gaussian Process component to explicitly model the spatio-temporal structure of the data and further improve accuracy. We evaluate our approach on county-level soybean yield prediction in the U.S. and show that it outperforms competing techniques.},
